Sample forum for PHP practice

This is a forum platform that I created using PHP, HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
This forum is for Breast Cancer Patients, Survivors and Doctors.
They can use the platform to share information and provide support to one another.
Anyone else who is willig to help support them can also join the forum.
