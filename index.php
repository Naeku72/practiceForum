    <p>Breast cancer in Kenya is the third most common cause of death after infectious and cardiovascular diseases. It contributes to 23.3% of cancer deaths. There are many factors that increase the chances of developing breast cancer. Although we know some of the risk factors, the main cause of breast cancer like any other cancer is not known. In Africa breast cancer kills more women over age 40 than HIV&AIDS and malaria combined. Five-year survival rates for breast cancer are much lower/worse in low and middle income countries.</p>

    <p>Our main aim is ro provide support for our users; breast cancer patients, survivors, doctors and other parties who have been affected by breast cancer one way or the other. Any other person(s) interested in supporting our users can feel free to join us</p>

    <h2>Types of breast cancer.</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer can begin in different areas of the breast â€” the ducts, the lobules, or in some cases, the tissue in between. In this section, you can learn about the different types of breast cancer, including non-invasive, invasive, and metastatic breast cancers, as well as the intrinsic or molecular subtypes of breast cancer. You can also read about breast cancer in men. </p>
