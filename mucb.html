    <h2>Types of breast cancer.</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer can begin in different areas of the breast — the ducts, the lobules, or in some cases, the tissue in between. In this section, you can learn about the different types of breast cancer, including non-invasive, invasive, and metastatic breast cancers, as well as the intrinsic or molecular subtypes of breast cancer. You can also read about breast cancer in men. </p>

    <h3>IDC Type: Mucinous Carcinoma of the Breast</h3>
    <p>Mucinous carcinoma of the breast — sometimes called colloid carcinoma — is a rare form of invasive ductal carcinoma (cancer that begins in the milk duct and spreads beyond it into nearby healthy tissue). In this type of cancer, the tumor is made up of abnormal cells that “float” in pools of mucin, a key ingredient in the slimy, slippery substance known as mucus.</p>

    <p>Normally, mucus lines most of the inner surface of our bodies, such as our digestive tract, lungs, liver, and other vital organs. Many types of cancer cells — including most breast cancer cells — produce some mucus. In mucinous carcinoma, however, mucin becomes part of the tumor and surrounds the breast cancer cells. Under a microscope, it looks like the cancer cells are scattered throughout pools of mucus.</p>

    <p>Research suggests that only about 2-3% of invasive breast cancers are “pure” mucinous carcinomas — meaning that this is the only type of cancer present within the tumor. About 5% of invasive breast cancers appear to have a mucinous component within them, with other types of cancer cells present as well. Mucinous carcinoma is extremely rare in men.</p>

    <p>Although mucinous carcinoma can be diagnosed at any age, it tends to affect women after they’ve gone through menopause. Some studies have found that the average age at diagnosis is in the 60s or early 70s.</p>

    <p>Even though mucinous carcinoma is an invasive breast cancer, it tends to be a less aggressive type that responds well to treatment. Mucinous carcinoma is less likely to spread to the lymph nodes than other types of breast cancer.</p>
