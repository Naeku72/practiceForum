    <h2>Types of breast cancer.</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer can begin in different areas of the breast — the ducts, the lobules, or in some cases, the tissue in between. In this section, you can learn about the different types of breast cancer, including non-invasive, invasive, and metastatic breast cancers, as well as the intrinsic or molecular subtypes of breast cancer. You can also read about breast cancer in men. </p>

    <h3>IDC Type: Papillary Carcinoma of the Breast</h3>
    <p>Invasive papillary carcinomas of the breast are rare, accounting for less than 1-2% of invasive breast cancers. In most cases, these types of tumors are diagnosed in older women who have already been through menopause. An invasive papillary carcinoma usually has a well-defined border and is made up of small, finger-like projections. Often it is grade 2, or moderate grade, on a scale of 1 to 3 — with grade 1 describing cancer cells that look and behave somewhat like normal, healthy breast cells, and grade 3 describing very abnormal, fast-growing cancer cells. In most cases of invasive papillary carcinoma, ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS) is also present. (DCIS is a type of cancer in which the carcinoma cells are confined to the breast duct.)</p>
