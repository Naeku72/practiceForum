    <h2>Types of breast cancer.</h2>
    <p>Breast cancer can begin in different areas of the breast — the ducts, the lobules, or in some cases, the tissue in between. In this section, you can learn about the different types of breast cancer, including non-invasive, invasive, and metastatic breast cancers, as well as the intrinsic or molecular subtypes of breast cancer. You can also read about breast cancer in men. </p>

    <h3>IDC Type: Tubular Carcinoma of the Breast</h3>
    <p>Tubular carcinoma of the breast is a subtype of invasive ductal carcinoma (cancer that begins inside the breast's milk duct and spreads beyond it into healthy tissue). Tubular carcinomas are usually small (about 1 cm or less) and made up of tube-shaped structures called "tubules." These tumors tend to be low-grade, meaning that their cells look somewhat similar to normal, healthy cells and tend to grow slowly.</p>

    <p>At one time, tubular carcinomas accounted for about 1-4% of all breast cancers. Now that screening mammography is widely used, however, tubular carcinomas are being diagnosed more frequently — often before you or your doctor would be able to feel a lump. Exact numbers aren't available, but studies suggest that tubular carcinomas may account for anywhere from just under 8% to 27% of all breast cancers.</p>

    <p>Studies also suggest that the average age of diagnosis for tubular carcinoma is the early 50s, although women can be diagnosed with it at any age. This type of cancer is rare in men.</p>

    <p>Even though tubular carcinoma is an invasive breast cancer, it tends to be a less aggressive type that responds well to treatment. It isn't likely to spread outside the breast and is considered to have a very good prognosis.</p>
